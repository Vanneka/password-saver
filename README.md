## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ÄçüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚Äç Password saving application üïµÔ∏èüïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚Äç

Never lose a password again with this secure password saving web application. This project came about when I realised I didn't have a place to securely store all my passwords in one place. Rather than download an app, I decided to build one.

### To use the app
1. Run `git clone` on this repository to clone the repo.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
3. Create your own custom environment values using the `env.sample` file

### To create an account
- Go to the signup page
- Fill in the form details with the appropriate details
- Click the signup button
- You will be redirected to the login page
- Login with your secure details to access your user dashboard

### To login to your account
- Enter the details you registered with into the `Login` page.
- You will be redirected to your dashboard on successful login

### User Dashboard

The user dashboard is your secure space for adding your passwords to different sites. In this space you can do the following:
- Add a password and a link to the login page the password is associated with.
- Update the password if you ever have to change it
- Delete a password when you close the associated account or no longer have any use for it

### The Password
By default, the password is hidden immediately you add it. To view and copy the password follow these steps
1. Click the `eye` icon on the right to toggle `hide/show` of your password.
2. When password is visible, you can copy the password.
